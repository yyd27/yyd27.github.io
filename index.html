            <p>I am a second-year PhD student in the <a target = "_blank" href="http://www.linguistics.northwestern.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>. Before coming to NU, I received my B.Sc. in Statistics and Psychology from <a target="_blank" href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, and worked as a research assistant at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/en/zhouxiao.html">Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences</a> there. </p> 
            <p>My research interests include computational psycholinguistics, reading process, and natural language processing. Currently I work in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.klintonbicknell.com/">Dr. Klinton Bicknell</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="http://lcl.northwestern.edu/">Language and Computation Lab</a> on computational mechanisms of eye movement and reading. </p>

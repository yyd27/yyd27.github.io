Here is what I did to build this my very first website. I used [Jekyll][jekyll], a static website generator, to build the website, and used [GitHub Pages][githubpage] to host this website. 

For building the website with Jekyll, I find this [video][youtube-howto] very useful. You can start with a theme you like from [Jekyll Themes][jekyll-themes]; my theme is [jekyllDecent][decent].

For publishing the website with GitHub Pages, I basically follow this [tutorial][githubhelp] and this [video][youtube-githubpage].
